> An evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is a strategy which, if adopted by a population in a given environment,      cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy that is initially rare.

The program allows to specify two strategies that can be adopted by the members of the population. "Life" of the population is simulated as an iterative process consisting of "days" and members who have "points". On each day an encounter can happen between two members whose points are changed based on their payoff for a given pair of strategies.
At the end of a life span of the current generation, the most succesful individuals give birth to the new generation.
The goal is to establish an evolutionarily stable strategy by simulating many iterations.
